**
-This is a starting point but needs refinement for real-world use. the matching logic in JS need far more sophistication and improvement.
-The movie selection for swiping is currently hardcoded and should be dynamically fetched.
-SQLite is used for ease of integration with Python but is not ideal
-Profile pictures are stored in an uploads folder as SQLite cannot handle image storage.
